# Welcome my hiring test!

## Implementation
Decided to implement the API by initializing a springboot project since it 
allows me to get started quickly with a Java application.

SWAGGER was used for documenting API, by using swagger annotations is really easy to get the API documentation always updated.
(To see API documentations refer to Running application section)

## Running the application

### To run the minesweeper application in you local machine you just need to:

 - Java 8 installed in your local 
 
 - Import   the project in Intellj IDEA and just run the project

 - API documentation will be available in http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html#/
